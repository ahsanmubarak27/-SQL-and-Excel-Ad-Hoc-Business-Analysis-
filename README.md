# SQL and Excel Ad Hoc Business Analysis

## Overview
This project simulates a real-world ad hoc request where business stakeholders ask questions about sales, profit, and expenses.  
The goal is to use SQL to query data, and Excel to create visual reports with insights and recommendations.

## Dataset
A simulated dataset with sales transactions, product categories, regions, customer segments, and monthly expenses.  
The data is structured to allow joins and analysis across multiple business dimensions.

## Tools
- SQL (MySQL and Table Plus)
- Excel (charts, conditional formatting, insights)

## Stakeholder Questions
1. What are the top product categories by sales and profit in 2023?  
2. Which customer segment has the highest average profit margin?  
3. Show monthly trend of sales vs total expenses during 2022–2023, and identify months with negative profit.  

## Approach
- Wrote SQL queries to answer each question.  
- Exported query results into Excel.  
- Built visualizations and added insights + recommendations for stakeholders.  

## Key Insights
- Electronics and Clothing were the top product categories in 2023.  
- Corporate customers had the highest profit margin, while Small Business was lower.  
- Several months showed negative net profit, mostly due to higher expenses not matched by profit growth.  

## Project Files
